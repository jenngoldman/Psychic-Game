This is a guessing game with two players: the user and the computer. The goal of the game is to guess the randomly generated letter the computer chose. The game starts when the user enters a letter on the keyboard. The user has 10 guesses to guess the correct answer and if they do, the game restarts and wins counter increases. If the user loses, the game restarts and loss counter increases by 1. 

Each guess is shown on the page as well as guesses remaining, wins, and losses. 


Betcha can't beat the computer on the first guess! Good luck!
